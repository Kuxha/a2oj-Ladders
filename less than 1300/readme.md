This was a simple greedy problem . Nothig much to learn.
Just add up all and check if they are zero or not

2. Beautiful Matrix

Here we just need to check how far the 1 is from the centre
Since the centre is at 2, so we do 
abs(2-row) ==> dist from centre rowwise
abs(2-col) ==> dist from centre columnwise

and then simply add them


3. Queue at the School

Here we need to swap every time we encounter this BG. and do this t times.
THats it. So we use a while loop , and then for every BG , we make it GB

I didn't do anything fancy here. Maybe I could have used set or something. all I did was take a for loop and check one by one. Thats it.

So I did this using simple if else and a for loop.

13. Perfect Permutation

If odd, not possible
If even, just interchange every two numbes in natural no.
1 2 3 4 5 6 becomes 2 1 4 3 6 5
