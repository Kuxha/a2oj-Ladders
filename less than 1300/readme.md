This was a simple greedy problem . Nothig much to learn.
Just add up all and check if they are zero or not

2. Beautiful Matrix

Link:https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/263/A

Here we just need to check how far the 1 is from the centre
Since the centre is at 2, so we do 
abs(2-row) ==> dist from centre rowwise
abs(2-col) ==> dist from centre columnwise

and then simply add them


3. Queue at the School

Here we need to swap every time we encounter this BG. and do this t times.
THats it. So we use a while loop , and then for every BG , we make it GB

. means 0, -. means 1 , -- means 2 . Simple if else and a for loop.

5. Beautiful Year

I didn't do anything fancy here. Maybe I could have used set or something. all I did was take a for loop and check one by one. Thats it.

6. Lights out

check for two same chars  together and count. 

11. Panoramix's Prediction

Did it by brute force.
Wrote all the next primes in an array

12. Ultra-Fast Mathematician

So I did this using simple if else and a for loop.

13. Perfect Permutation 

Link:https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/233/A

If odd, not possible
If even, just interchange every two numbes in natural no.
1 2 3 4 5 6 becomes 2 1 4 3 6 5

So I did this using hash earlier. Thought of doing the same .
But then saw a brilliant solution. Just add the two strings. sort them.
Then check if same or not

First we need to get the sum of all the other fingers put up.
Then. One by one just check what happens if we add 1,2,3,4 or 5. and only if they divide totally, we can be sure that we wont get chosen.

32. Jzzhu and Children
