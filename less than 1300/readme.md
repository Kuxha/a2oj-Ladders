This was a simple greedy problem . Nothig much to learn.
Just add up all and check if they are zero or not

2. Beautiful Matrix

Link:https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/263/A

Here we just need to check how far the 1 is from the centre
Since the centre is at 2, so we do 
abs(2-row) ==> dist from centre rowwise
abs(2-col) ==> dist from centre columnwise

and then simply add them


3. Queue at the School

Here we need to swap every time we encounter this BG. and do this t times.
THats it. So we use a while loop , and then for every BG , we make it GB

4. Borze

First we need to get the sum of all the other fingers put up.
Then. One by one just check what happens if we add 1,2,3,4 or 5. and only if they divide totally, we can be sure that we wont get chosen.

32. Jzzhu and Children

The key thing to notice in this task is, if we can arrange the characters of the string we have into a palindrome, then there can be at most one character with an odd amount of occurences. This easily gives us the answer: if there are <= 1 characters with an odd amount of occurences in the initial string, then the winner is the first player. Otherwise, the answer is dependant on whether the amount of characters with odd amounts of occurences is even or odd; if it's even then the second player wins, otherwise the first player wins (since the one who is forced to get this amount to one first is going to lose).
