1. Young Physicist

This was a simple greedy problem . Nothig much to learn.
Just add up all and check if they are zero or not

2. Beautiful Matrix

Here we just need to check how far the 1 is from the centre
Since the centre is at 2, so we do 
abs(2-row) ==> dist from centre rowwise
abs(2-col) ==> dist from centre columnwise

and then simply add them
